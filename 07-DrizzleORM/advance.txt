The Problem: You want to show a list of all post titles and the author's name. 
The posts table only has the authorId, not the name. The users table has the name, but not the post title. 
The data is split.


SELECT 
post.title,
user.name,
from posts
INNER JOINT USERS ON posts.authorId = users.Id

const information  =  await db.select({
    poststitle:posts.title,
    authorName:user.name
}).from(posts).innerjoint(users,eq(posts.authorid,user.id))



//left joint
SELECT
  users.name,
  posts.title
FROM users -- 'users' is the LEFT table
LEFT JOIN posts ON users.id = posts.authorId;

const leftjoin = await db.select({
    postName:posts.title,
    authorName:user.name
}).from(user)
.leftjoin(posts,eq(users.id, posts.authorId))


SELECT * FROM users RIGHT JOIN posts ON users.id = posts.authorId;




No problem at all. This is the most confusing part of JOINs. Let's put them side-by-side.
The only difference is which table you decide is the "main" one.
LEFT = The first table (in FROM) is the main one.
RIGHT = The second table (in JOIN) is the main one.
